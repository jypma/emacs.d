Logview mode provides syntax highlighting, filtering and other
features for various log files.  The main target are files similar
to ones generated by Log4j, Logback and other Java logging
libraries, but there is really nothing Java-specific in the mode
and it should work just fine with any log that follows similar
structure, probably after some configuration.
