	Speed up the load of the dired buffer

	It has been noted that we can significantly speed up the load of the
	Dired buffer by checking more often the completion of the
	`du' processes. Problem reported by Pierre Neidhardt here: 
	https://github.com/calancha/dired-du/issues/1
	* packages/dired-du/dired-du.el
	(dired-du-get-recursive-dir-size-in-parallel): check for `du' process
	completion more often.

	* dired-du.el (dired-du-update-dir-info): New command.
