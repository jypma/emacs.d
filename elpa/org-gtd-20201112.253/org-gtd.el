;;; Commentary:

;; This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow.
;; This package, and this readme, assume familiarity with GTD. There are many
;; resources out there to learn how to use the framework. If you are new to GTD,
;; this package may be unpleasant to use.
;;
;; Assuming the keybindings below are used, here is how you could use org-gtd:
;; GTD uses one basic axiom: everything that comes your way goes into the inbox.
;; You do this with ~C-c d c~.
;; You also have to regularly process the inbox, which you do with ~C-c d p~.
;;
;; When you process the inbox, you will see each inbox item, one at a time,
;; with an interface letting you decide what to do with the item:
;;
;; - *Quick Action* :: You've taken care of this action just now. Choose this to mark the item as DONÎ• and archive it.
;; - *Throw out* :: This is not actionable and it's not knowledge for later. Choose this to mark the item as CANCELED and archive it.
;; - *Project* :: This is a multi-step action. I'll describe how to handle these below.
;; - *Calendar* :: This is a single item to be done at a given date or time. You'll be presented with org-mode's date picker, then it'll refile the item. You'll find this in the agenda later.
;; - *Delegate* :: Let someone else do this. Write the name of the person doing it, and choose a time to check up on that item.
;; - *Single action* :: This is a one-off to be done when possible. You can add tags to help you.
;; - *Reference* :: This is knowledge to be stored away. I'll describe how to handle these below.
;; - *Incubate* :: no action now, review later
;;
;; When processing each item you'll get a chance to add tags and other such
;; metadata. This package will add keywords (e.g. NEXT, TODO, DONE) for you,
;; so don't worry about them. Do the work that only you can do, and let this
;; package handle the bookkeeping.
;;
;; A "project" is defined as an org heading with a set of children headings.
;;
;; When you are processing the inbox and creating a project, Emacs enters a
;; recursive edit mode to let you define and refine the project.
;; When finished, press ~C-c c~ to exit the recursive edit and go back to
;; processing the inbox.
;;
;; One of the ways to see what's next for you to do is to see all the next
;; actions ( ~C-c d n~ ).
;;
;; Sometimes things break. Use ~C-c d s~ to find all projects that don't have a
;; NEXT item, which is to say, all projects that the package will not surface
;; and help you finish.
;;
;; Here's a commented block showing a possible
;; configuration for this package.
;;
;;   ;; these are the interactive functions you're likely to want to use as you go about GTD.

;;   (setq org-agenda-files `(,org-gtd-directory))
