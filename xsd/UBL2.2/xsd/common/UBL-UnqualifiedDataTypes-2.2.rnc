# 
# This schema fragment implements UBL unqualified datatypes using core
# component types with all supplementary components as described in
# CCTS 2.01 http://www.unece.org/cefact/ebxml/CCTS_V2-01_Final.pdf tables
# 8-1, 8-2 and 8-3.
# 
# Per table 8-3, the graphic, picture, sound and video types are based on
# "Binary Object. Type" as they are secondary representation terms.
# 
# Per table 8-3, the value, rate and percentage types are based on
# "Numeric. Type" as they are secondary representation terms.
# 
# Per table 8-3, the name type is based on "Text. Type" as it is a 
# secondary representation term.
# 
# Per XSD lexical constraints, the following unqualified data types 
# corresponding to core component types and secondary representation terms 
# are based on XSD types (accordingly, the supplementary component "format" 
# is not made available for these types):
# 
#       Date Time. Type  on  xsd:dateTime
#       Date. Type       on  xsd:date
#       Time. Type       on  xsd:time
#       Indicator. Type  on  xsd:boolean
# 
# Per UBL 2.0 the following supplementary components are restricted to be
# required rather than optional:
# 
#  Amount. Currency. Identifier  as  (AmountType)/@currencyID
#  Binary Object. Mime. Code     as  (BinaryObjectType)/@mimeCode
#  Graphic. Mime. Code           as  (GraphicType)/@mimeCode
#  Picture. Mime. Code           as  (PictureType)/@mimeCode
#  Sound. Mime. Code             as  (SoundType)/@mimeCode
#  Video. Mime. Code             as  (VideoType)/@mimeCode
#  Measure. Unit. Code           as  (MeasureType)/@unitCode
# 
# All other unqualified data types inherit the core component types complete
# with their supplementary components.
